ytmp
====

Play videos from video hosting services without the need of Flash.

Sure, there are a number of alternative methods (such as bookmarklets, userJS,
command line tools and complete desktop clients) that achieve the same goal,
but `ytmp` does it differently.

`ytmp` includes a daemon, utilising `ngrep` to watch for traffic destined to
one of the supported sites (below). The `ytmp` client then receives a
(formatted) link to the video, which is passed to `youtube-dl` for downloading
or streaming in your favourite media player.

This approach therefore provides an interface to `youtube-dl`, requiring no user
intervention, while remaining browser agnostic: just visit a video hosting site
as normal and watch the video without Flash!

Supported sites
---------------

* YouTube
* Vimeo

Dependencies
------------

* `ngrep`
* `youtube-dl`

* Your favourite media player (the developers use `mplayer`)

### Optional

* `zenity`: for (GTK) GUI support
* `kdialog`: for KDE GUI support
* `dmenu`: for dmenu GUI support

Usage
-----

### Configuring ytmp.conf

* Specify your network interface (usually *eth0* or *wlan0*)
* Choose a GUI
* Specify the command of your favourite media player
* Optionally set the download path and YouTube quality setting

### General usage

(Note: the following is targeted to Arch Linux users)

1. Start the `ngrep` wrapper as root:

        $ sudo /etc/rc.d/ytmpd start

2. Launch the `ytmpc` client:

        $ /usr/bin/ytmpc

3. Open a video (from the list of supported sites) in your browser

4. Video automatically plays in your chosen media player
